## Active searches
###  Active object search
     [**link to file**](Active Searches/active object search.pdf)

    In this paper, we study the problem of active visual search (AVS) in large, unknown, or partially known environments.
    We argue that by making use of uncertain semantics of the envi- ronment, a robot tasked with finding an object can devise
    efficient search strategies that can locate everyday objects at the scale of an entire building floor, which is previously
    unknown to the robot. To realize this, we present a probabilistic model of the search en- vironment, which allows for prioritizing
    the search effort to those parts of the environment that are most promising for a specific object type. Further,
    we describe a method for reasoning about the unexplored part of the environment for goal-directed exploration with
    the purpose of object search. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by comparing it with two other search systems
    in terms of search trajectory length and time. First, we implement a greedy coverage-based search strategy that is found
    in previous work. Second, we let human participants search for objects as an alternative comparison for our method.
    Our results show that AVS strategies that exploit uncertain semantics of the environment are a very promising idea,
    and our method pushes the state-of-the-art forward in AVS.
